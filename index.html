    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>In my exploration of datasets from the New York City government, I focused on the correlation between average income and recycling rates across boroughs in the greater New York region. This analysis revealed compelling insights into how socioeconomic factors influence environmental behaviors.

<h2>
  
  Data Insights</h2>
Through data analysis, I uncovered a strong correlation between income levels and recycling rates. Affluent boroughs such as Manhattan and Staten Island exhibited higher rates of recycling per household compared to less affluent areas like The Bronx and Brooklyn. This correlation underscores the influence of economic resources on environmental practices, where higher income brackets typically correlate with greater environmental consciousness and accessibility to recycling infrastructure.
      <br>
      <br>
To visually represent these findings effectively in my map, I employed two primary methods: color manipulation and size variation. Color gradients were utilized to denote average incomes across boroughs, with darker shades representing higher income levels. This choice, using purple as a symbol of wealth, aimed to intuitively convey the socioeconomic disparities across the city. In contrast, size variations of recycling symbols were used to illustrate recycling rates per household, with larger symbols indicating higher rates and smaller symbols indicating lower rates. This method ensured that the visual representation not only depicted the disparities in recycling behavior but also highlighted the magnitude of these differences in a clear and compelling manner.
      <br>
      <br>
For the infographic, I opted for a bar chart represented by iconic New York City skyscrapers, where the height of each building represented the average recycling per household in tons. The use of green shades within the skyscrapers further indicated the average income for each borough. This design decision aimed to make the infographic both visually engaging and informative, appealing to a broad audience interested in environmental and socioeconomic issues. I also included facts about the relationship between recycling and income
      <br>
      <br>
  <h2>Real-World Applications</h2>
  
The insights and visualizations from this research hold significant potential for real-world applications across several domains:
  <br>
      <br>
Policy Making: 
  <br>
     Policymakers and urban planners can use these insights to target investments in recycling infrastructure. By focusing resources on neighborhoods with lower recycling rates, they can promote more equitable environmental practices.
<br>
      <br>
Community Engagement: 
  <br> Community organizations and environmental advocates can utilize these visualizations to raise awareness about the intersection of income disparities and recycling behaviors. This can empower communities to advocate for improved recycling facilities and practices in underserved areas.
 <br> <br>
Educational Tools:  <br>Educational institutions can incorporate these visualizations into curricula to teach students about environmental justice, socioeconomic influences on behavior, and the importance of recycling in mitigating climate change. My visualization could be shown as a nuanced perspective on the climate change movement. In many instances, lower to middle class workers may not have the resources or time to reflect on their climate impact. Some examples include apartment buildings in lower-income areas may not have adequate recycling, or people with lower incomes may have less time due to multiple jobs or other pressing responsibilities, or they may lack the resources like a vehicle to transport recyclables.
 <br> <br>
In conclusion, my research and visualizations not only uncover the nuanced relationship between income and recycling rates in New York City but also provide actionable insights for addressing environmental disparities. By bridging data analysis with impactful design decisions, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of how socioeconomic factors shape environmental behaviors and offers practical applications for fostering more inclusive and sustainable communities.
